# One man's toxic sludge is another man's potpourri! 
 - Use a furnace or blast furnace to cook rotten flesh, spider eyes, or pufferfish into less dangerous, still kinda gross treats! These items are too toxic to be sterilized in a smoker or atop a campfire.

 - Combine your three vile snacks with a bowl to create "Potpourri," a ~~disgusting~~ delicious meal!
